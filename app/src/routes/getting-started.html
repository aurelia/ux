      <h1>What is Aurelia UX?</h1>
  
      <p>
        Aurelia UX is a companion framework to Aurelia. While Aurelia focuses on being
        a <em>front-end framework</em> by providing core capabilities you need to build apps, such as templating, binding and routing,
        Aurelia UX focuses on being a <em>user experience framework</em> by providing
        higher-level capabilities such as design languages, theming and components.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Aurelia UX is still in a very early stage but we'd love for you to play with it
        and consider contributing. We'll keep this app updated as we add new features
        so it's easy for you to track our progress.
      </p>

      <h1>Setting Up Aurelia UX</h1>

      <p>
        Getting setup with Aurelia UX is a quick process, and depending on your bundler of choice can be ready to go with a quick
        npm command and a couple lines of code.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Available Packages</h2>
    
      <p>
        Starting with <code>0.4.0</code>, Aurelia UX has moved to use a Monorepo approach. Using Lerna, we have been able to
        split out the various components into self-contained packages within a single repository. To manage this, we've moved
        to publishing all Aurelia UX packages under the aurelia-ux NPM organization. This makes it so you can easily pick
        which ones you want to use. We've also split out the core so that you can use the style engine independently of the
        components.
      </p>
    
      <strong>@aurelia-ux/components package</strong>
    
      <p>
        There is a components package that contains all of the standard UX components to help you get started faster.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Installing Aurelia</h2>
    
      <h3>Webpack</h3>
    
      <p>
        There is not much you are required to do to get Aurelia UX working with webpack.
      </p>
    
      <strong>Install Aurelia UX Core and Components</strong>
      <code-block type="shell">
        npm install @aurelia-ux/core @aurelia-ux/components --save
      </code-block>
    
      <strong>Setup the plugin in your application configuration</strong>
      <code-block>
        import {Aurelia} from 'aurelia-framework';
        import {PLATFORM} from 'aurelia-pal';
        import environment from './environment';
      
        export function configure(aurelia: Aurelia) {
          aurelia.use
            .standardConfiguration()
            .feature(PLATFORM.moduleName('resources/index'));
        
            aurelia.use
            .plugin(PLATFORM.moduleName('@aurelia-ux/core'))
            .plugin(PLATFORM.moduleName('@aurelia-ux/components'));
        
          if (environment.debug) {
            aurelia.use.developmentLogging();
          }
        
          if (environment.testing) {
            aurelia.use.plugin(PLATFORM.moduleName('aurelia-testing'));
          }
        
          aurelia.start().then(() => aurelia.setRoot(PLATFORM.moduleName('app')));
        }
      </code-block>
    
      <p>And that is it, you are ready to start using Aurelia UX.</p>
      <h3>Aurelia CLI</h3>
    
      <p>
        Installing Aurelia UX with the Aurelia CLI has an extra step compared to Webpack.
      </p>
    
      <strong>Updating the Aurelia Json</strong>
    
      <code-block type="json">
        {
          "name": "@aurelia-ux/core",
          "path": "../node_modules/@aurelia-ux/core/dist/amd",
          "main": "index",
          "resources": ["**/*.{css,html}"]
        },
        {
          "name": "@aurelia-ux/components",
          "path": "../node_modules/@aurelia-ux/components/dist/amd",
          "main": "index",
          "resources": ["**/*.{css,html}"]
        },
        {
          "name": "@aurelia-ux/input",
          "path": "../node_modules/@aurelia-ux/input/dist/amd",
          "main": "index",
          "resources": ["**/*.{js,css,html}"]
        },
        ...
        // Do this for each plugin so that all the modules can be resolved
      </code-block>
    
      <p>And that is it, you are ready to start using Aurelia UX.</p>
