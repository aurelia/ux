## Building

**Before The First Build**

`npm install` installs dependencies for the base Aurelia UX project

`lerna bootstrap --hoist`: sets up a symlink between all of the packages in the monorepo
`lerna run build`: builds all of the mono repo projects.

>Note: `lerna run build` is very CPU intensive and takes a small period of time on most machines. If you are working within a single component, you might try `npm run build` instead at the component level.

## Tests

### From the project's root directory

`npm run test -- --package=name` runs the tests for the specified package (defaults to `-- --package=core` when omitted)

`lerna run test` runs the tests for all packages (will start multiple chrome instances simultaneously)

### From a package's own directory

`npm run test` runs the tests for that package

## Developing

### From the project's root directory

`npm run develop -- --package=name` runs the tests for the specified package in `watch` mode  (defaults to `-- --package=core` when omitted)

### From a package's own directory

`npm run develop` runs the tests for that package in `watch` mode
